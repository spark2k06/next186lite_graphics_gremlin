      FREELOAD.SYS :  Ver. 2.1, Copyright (1992,93) by Philip B. Gardner
================================================================================

  FREELOAD.SYS is a device driver which will help maximize the use of low
  memory by releasing memory usually reserved in low memory by LOADHI.SYS
  from Quarterdeck Office Systems. 

  FREELOAD.SYS tracks the high memory device loader operations and if it
  is safe to release the low memory after each device initiates, the low
  memory is released and the driver in upper memory is linked into the DOS
  device chain.

  FREELOAD.SYS can be used to save 1-2k in a typical configuration.  The
  actual amount of memory saved depends upon on the number and type of
  device drivers loaded high.

  Support is provided for:

    * fully automatic support of QEMM's LOADHI.SYS and 386MAX's 386LOAD.SYS
    * specifying the name and path of the device loader
    * both character and block devices
    * character drivers which contain an unlimited number of devices
    * DOS Versions 3.1 - 3.31, DOS 4.x, and DOS 5.x (or better?)

================================================================================

(Requirements)::

        * Requires MS-DOS Version 3.10 or better

================================================================================

(Installation)::

        (CONFIG.SYS)::

        Installation of FREELOAD.SYS requires modifying the contents of
        your CONFIG.SYS file.

(Generic Configuration)::

        This configuration should work and be the most efficient in 95%
        of all configurations.  For a few real world examples see
        EXAMPLES.DOC

        DOS=HIGH[,UMB]                    (DOS 5.0 only)
        REM DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS [options]  (Stops kernel from loading in HMA)
        DEVICE=(xms/umb memory manager)
        DEVICE=DOSMAX.EXE [options]       (DOSMAX loads high automatically)
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS [-S][other options]
        REM DEVICE=LOADHI.SYS DOSMAX.EXE  (or DOSMAX loaded high with loader)
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM COMMAND.COM /P
        BUFFERS=20
        FILES=40
        LASTDRIVE=Z

        Add a DEVICE= line for FREELOAD.SYS in your config.sys.  FREELOAD
        should be loaded immediately after the XMS and UMB memory manager

        DEVICE=(Memory Manager)
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS [options]

        The default loader pathname is "C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS".  If FREELOAD
        cannot open this pathname, a message will displayed alerting you
        to "Use /Fpathname to override."  An example which uses this switch
        is shown below:

        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS /F D:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS

        Version 1.8 adds full 386MAX support, so if 386MAX is detected, or
        the /A2 switch is used, then the default loader pathname is changed
        to "C:\386MAX\386LOAD.SYS."

(Tip)::

        If you prefer that a particular device driver is not affected by
        the operation of FREELOAD, place the DEVICE= for that device above
        the DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS entry.  This may be necessary in the case
        that a particular driver is not compatible with FREELOAD.

================================================================================

(Syntax)::

        The only thing to remember about syntax for the command line is
        that just about anything works.  What this means is that you
        should be able to type in the options on the command line the
        way they make sense to you.

        To illustrate this point, the following command line example
        is mutated several different ways.

        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS /R+ /P+ /FC:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS -R+ -P+ -F C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS R+ P+ F C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS R+P+FC:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS -R+P+FC:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS

        ... and so on.  There must be an EOL or space following the
        filename paramter the /Fpathname switch

        FREELOAD 1.9 and above adds optional full word syntax.  The new
        syntax looks like this:

        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS /REPORT:- /PAUSE:- /LOADER=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS -REPORT:- -PAUSE:- -LOADER=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS REPORT:- PAUSE:- LOADER=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS REPORT-PAUSE-LOADER=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS
        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS -REPORT-PAUSE--LOADER=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS

        Obviously when using full words, it is easier to keep the words
        separated so that is clear to read.  An optional [:] or [=] may be
        used for switches (i.e. REPORT:+ or LOADER=C:\LOADHI.SYS).  These
        optional delimiters are used interchangeably and can also be used
        with the single letter switches.  Remember to check your spelling
        because the single letter interface is still intact.

(Switch Options)::

        The following list of switch options is organized by:

        - Control of FREELOAD Reports (/R:/P:/N:)
        - Override the Default Name and Path of the Loader (/F=)
        - Setting the Memory Strategy (/M=)
        - Overriding Directory Structure Size (/D=)
        - Control the Alternate Memory Manager Method (/A=)
        - Controlling the Shrink Feature (/S:)
        - Response file for FREELOAD (@)

    (Control of FREELOAD Reports)::

        (REPORT)::      R[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /R- or /REPORT:- to disable the report after you are
        satisfied with the configuration of DOSMAX.EXE

        (PAUSE)::       P[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /P- or /PAUSE:- to disable the pause after the report as
        long as there are no errors or warnings.

        (NOPAUSE)::     N[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /N+ or /NOPAUSE:+ to never pause after the report, even if
        there are errors.  This switch can be used if your configuration
        generates a warning or error message which you choose to ignore.

    (Override the Default Name and Path of the Loader)::

        (LOADER)::      F[pathname]      (string=  default=C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS)

        Use /Fpathname or /LOADER=pathname to specify the filename and path
        of the device loader provided with your upper memory manager.  For
        example, if this device driver is on drive D:

                DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS /FD:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS

        If FREELOAD cannot find this file, it will not load.

    (Setting the Memory Strategy)::

        (STRATEGY)::    Mn               (value:  n = 0)   

        Use /Mn or /STRATEGY=n to control the memory allocation strategy
        which FREELOAD uses to allocate its upper memory block.  The default
        strategy is is First Fit (/M0).  This means that FREELOAD will use
        the first upper memory block returned by the XMS manager.  The other
        options are Best Fit (/M1) and Last Fit (/M2).  Best Fit uses the
        block which most closely matches the size needed, and Last Fit uses
        the highest block big enough to handle the request.  Values other
        than 0, 1, or 2 are ignored and the previous setting of this option
        is used.
 
    (Overriding Directory Structure Size)::

        (CDSSIZE)::     Dnn              (value:  nn = 88)

        Use /Dnn or /CDSSIZE=nn to set the Drive Table Size.  Values other
        than the MS-DOS 4.0 - 6.0 Drive Table Size of 88 are only allowed if
        the true MS-DOS version is greater than 5.0.  The Drive Table Size
        for DOS 3.x is 81. The /Dnn switch is only necessary if FREELOAD
        can't determine the Drive Table Size automatically.

    (Control the Alternate Memory Manager Method)::

        (ALTMETHOD)::   An               (value:  n = 0)

        Use /An to select the method FREELOAD uses to detect and track
        high device loaders.  There are 3 possible values.  (0), the
        default, means that FREELOAD will automatically select the proper
        method.  (1), method 1 is for device loaders compatible with
        LOADHI.SYS from Quarterdeck.  (2), method 2 is for device loaders
        compatible with 386LOAD.SYS from Qualitas.  This switch is included
        only for debugging purposes.

    (Controlling the Shrink Feature)

        (SHRINK)::      S[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        FREELOAD normally takes approximately 1.4K of high memory. Use /S+
        or /SHRINK:+ to reduce this requirement to 16 bytes just before
        the shell is loaded from CONFIG.SYS.  Shrinking may cause problems
        with high memory optimizers, but the switch can be safely used
        after the system is optimized, to free another 1.4K of high memory.

  (Response file for FREELOAD)::

        Parameters for FREELOAD may be read from a response file by using the
        @pathname syntax:
        
        FREELOAD.SYS @RESPONSE.FIL
 
        Response files may be commented by using a ";","#",or "*" character
        before the comment.

        *  everything in square brackets "[]" is optional

(CONFIG.SYS Line)::

        DEVICE=FREELOAD.SYS [/ or -][R[+]P[+]N[+]S[+]Fpathname]

        device mode default: /R-/P-/N-/S-/Mn/FC:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS

        *  No Report status messages
        *  No Pause after report
        *  Pause on errors or warnings
        *  Use the First Fit memory allocation strategy
        *  Default Loader Pathname = "C:\QEMM\LOADHI.SYS"

(Changes)::

    (Version 1.1)::

    (1) Fixed problem where character devices were skipped if a
        block device was loaded first

    (2) Added support for block devices.  This grew the size of
        FREELOAD to 880 bytes so FREELOAD now shrinks to 16 bytes
        when finished.  This frees a .8k block of upper memory
        which is not needed after all devices are loaded.

    (Version 1.2)::

    (1) Added support for character drivers which contain multiple
        devices.  There is a requirement for 16 bytes of low
        memory for a multiple device driver, but this 16 bytes
        supports an unlimited number of devices within the driver.
        Without the 16 bytes, DOS believes the initialization of the
        driver has failed and only the first device is linked.

    (Version 1.3)::

    (1) Fixed problem with failing to build a Drive Parameter Block
        when a multiple device driver ended with a block device.

    (2) Changed automatic reduce to a command line option.  FREELOAD
        now takes 1K bytes high.  If the /S+ (shrink option is used)
        this size is reduced to 16 bytes just before the shell is loaded.

    (Version 1.4)::

    (1) Improved multiple device failure mode.  If a multiple device
        driver has begun the initiate phase and fails, the high device
        is left unlinked, and the loader is left in place with memory
        and the device chain set to the length of the last successful
        initialization.  This method more closely emultates DOS.

    (2) Added check that resets FREELOAD if the loader doesn't load the
        device in high memory successfully.

    (3) Optimized code to reduce memory requirement back to 1K

    (Version 1.5)::

    (1) Added base 10 display of Drive Table Size message

    (Version 1.6)::

    (1) Added support for DOS 5 UMB's when moving FREELOAD upto upper
        memory.  Some device loaders will work with DOS 5 UMB's, and
        now you can use the loader instead of DEVICEHIGH= if you want.

    (2) Added /Mn option, to allow general control of memory allocation
        strategy.  First Fit = 0, Best Fit = 1, and Last Fit = 2 were
        implemented for both DOS 5 UMB's, and XMS UMB's.

    (3) Added check for a 186 processor or better (allows V20/V30).

    (4) Now supporting separate program FREELO86.SYS.  This program is
        functionally identical to FREELO86.SYS, but is compiled to work
        on 8086/8088 processors also.  The stub left in high memory
        is 16 bytes greater using with this variation.

    (Version 1.7)::

    (1) Changed common parsing algorithum to add support for Hex-Notation
        input.  This input method is not used in FREELOAD at this time.

    (2) Fixed case where device fails but the loader tells DOS the device
        was ok.  The high memory block is released, but the loader still
        reserves low memory.  FREELOAD linked the released driver, but now
        detects the condition, does not complete the link, and releases
        the stub.

    (Version 1.8)::

    (1) Added automatic support for 386LOAD.SYS from Qualitas.  The proper
        method FREELOAD uses is determined automatically, but may be
        overridden with the /An switch.  The option adds as much as
        246 bytes to the pre-shrink size of FREELOAD.

    (2) DOS 3.x and 4.x with FREELOAD and 386LOAD was crashing because
        the 386LOAD stub hooked INT 21h, apparently to return a different
        DOS version to the device being loaded.  This "feature" is now
        disabled by FREELOAD so that the stub may be freed.  DOS 5 (and
        above?) used func 4B05h (set execution state), so the hook checking
        is bypassed.  The hook checking is implemented for /A2 only (or
        auto /A0).

    (3) If method 2 (/A2 or 386MAX detected with /A0), the default loader
        name is "C:\386MAX\386LOAD.SYS."  This makes compatability with
        386MAX completely transparent to the user in most cases.

    (Version 1.9)::

    (1)  Reorganized code to enable an overlay method of module selection
         to automate processor selection and split up .SYS and .EXE modules
         to reduce the initialization memory to minimum.

    (2)  FREELOAD now automatically detects the processor type and chooses
         separate code modules if appropriate.  The 186 processor require-
         ment of previous versions is no longer applicable.

    (3)  Added optional full word syntax to argument parser.  The old style
         single letter switch interface is still intact.  The switch lists
         now show the optional word with the switch.

    (Version 2.0)::

    (1)  Added support for DOS 6.0's changes in the way devices are
         initialized.  FREELOAD 1.7 was not compatible with DOS 6.0 or
         DBLSPACE.  FREELOAD 2.0 now supports the new version seamlessly.

    (2)  Added support for loaders which build sub-segments for devices
         in high memory.  This caused problems while preparing block
         devices.

    (3)  Added option response file input with @filename.opt syntax

    (Version 2.1)::

    (1)  Fixed problem with finding DOS 6.0 CONFIG variable for machines
         whose bios'es don't intialize memory properly.

    (2)  Fixed problem with some configurations of non-DOS 6.x systems
         and non-DBLSPACE systems which caused an Exception 13 after
         FREELOAD was loaded.
