================================================================================

  SHELLMAX.COM is a utility which loads the primary shell high from the
  SHELL= line in your CONFIG.SYS.

  Support is provided for:

        * Loading the primary SHELL into high memory
        * Creating a primary SHELL stub in low memory
          (improves compatability with some configurations)

================================================================================

(Requirements)::

        * Requires MS-DOS Version 3.10 or better

================================================================================

(Installation)::

        (CONFIG.SYS)::

        Installation of SHELLMAX.COM requires modifying the contents of
        your CONFIG.SYS file.

        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM [options] COMMAND.COM /P

        Insert SHELLMAX.COM in your SHELL= line of your CONFIG.SYS.
        SHELLMAX.  

(Safety)::

        When installing SHELLMAX, it is best if you copy SHELLMAX.COM and
        COMMAND.COM (the primary shell), to the root directory of your boot
        drive.  If SHELLMAX fails to function properly with the parameters
        in your SHELL= command line, it will issue a series of error messages,
        and then try and load COMMAND.COM from the root directory.  This will
        give you a chance to edit the CONFIG.SYS and correct the problem.
        You should exercise caution and have a boot floppy available.

        SHELLMAX is compatible with full SHELL= command line specifications.
        In the following example, neither SHELLMAX.COM or COMMAND.COM is
        required in the root directory after installation is successful, as
        indicated by no error or warning messages.

        SHELL=C:\BOOT\SHELLMAX.COM /R- C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS /E:512 /P

        All switch options and possible messages for SHELLMAX are detailed
        below:

================================================================================

(Compatibility)::

    (4DOS)::

        If you are using Version 4.x 4DOS from J.P. Software, you should
        add the path to 4DOS.COM to the 4DOS command line.

        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM C:\4DOS /p

        If this parameter is not added, 4DOS may not set the environment
        variable "COMSPEC=" properly.

    (DOS 3.x & 4.x)::

        Some versions of DOS incorrectly truncate the command line to 35
        characters for the SHELL= statement in the CONFIG.SYS or fail to
        pass a command line at all if the line is over 35 characters.
        This bug is circumvented by a special algorithum in SHELLMAX.  If
        SHELLMAX does not work for you, and you suspect that this is the
        problem, please contact me for assistance.

================================================================================

(Syntax)::

        The only thing to remember about syntax for the command line is
        that just about anything works.  What this means is that you
        should be able to type in the options on the command line the
        way they make sense to you.

        To illustrate this point, the following command line example
        is mutated several different ways.

        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM /R- /P+ /S+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM -R- -P+ -S+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM /R-/P+/S+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM -R--P+-S+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P

        ... and so on.

        SHELLMAX 2.0 and above adds optional full word syntax.  The new
        syntax looks like this:

        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM /REPORT:- /PAUSE:+ /FAKESTUB:+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM -REPORT:- -PAUSE:+ -FAKESTUB:+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM /REPORT:-/PAUSE:+/FAKESTUB:+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM -REPORT:--PAUSE:+-FAKESTUB:+ C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /P

        Obviously when using full words, it is easier to keep the words
        separated so that is clear to read.  The optional [:] is used
        for toggle switches (i.e. REPORT:+).  These optional delimiters
        can also be used with the single letter switches.  Exact spelling
        is required because the single letter interface is still intact.

(Switch Options)::

        The following list of switch options is organized by:

          - Control of SHELLMAX Reports (/R:/P:/N:)
          - Control the Configuration of a Fake Low Memory Stub (/S:)
          - Response file for SHELLMAX (@)

    (Control of SHELLMAX Reports)::

        (REPORT)::      R[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /R- or /REPORT:- to disable the report after you are
        satisfied with the configuration of STOPMAX.SYS

        (PAUSE)::       P[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /P- or /PAUSE:- to disable the pause after the report as
        long as there are no errors or warnings.

        (NOPAUSE)::     N[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /N+ or /NOPAUSE:+ to never pause after the report, even if
        there are errors.  This switch can be used if your configuration
        generates a warning or error message which you choose to ignore.

    (Control the Configuration of a Fake Low Memory Stub)

        (FAKESTUB)::    S[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        If you use SHELLMAX to load the shell high, then some programs
        (environment editors and some networks), are confused that no
        portion of the primary shell is is low memory.  Use /S+ or 
        /FAKESTUB:+ to tell SHELLMAX to create a fake stub, which looks
        like the primary shell, in low memory.  This stub tracks changes
        to the Master Environment segment pointer by monitoring the real
        stub high (each "get exit code of sub-program"  INT 21h, 4Dh).
        The stub size is 256 bytes, so if you use 4DOS, and find that
        you need the low stub, it is better to just let 4DOS do it and
        not use SHELLMAX.

  (Response file for SHELLMAX)::

        Parameters for SHELLMAX may be read from a response file by using the
        @pathname syntax:
        
        SHELLMAX.COM @RESPONSE.FIL C:\COMMAND.COM C:\ /E:512 /P
 
        Notice that the path to the SHELL is cannot be in the response file.

        Response files may be commented by using a ";","#",or "*" character
        before the comment.

        *  everything in square brackets "[]" is optional

(CONFIG.SYS Line)::

        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM [/R-/P+/N+/S+] COMMAND.COM /P

        default:  /R+/P-/N-/S-

        *  Report status messages
        *  Don't Pause after report
        *  Pause on errors or warnings
        *  Don't Fake stub low

(Changes)::

    (Version 1.7)::

    (1)  Found a workaround to 4DOS 4.x initialization hang.  4DOS now will
         load properly.  One caveat, add path to 4DOS to the 4DOS command
         line or 4DOS will not find 4DOS.INI or set the COMSPEC variable
         correctly.

    (2)  Corrected problem with DOS 3.x and DOS 4.x when the standard handles
         were getting closed by mistake.

    (3)  When COMMAND.COM path argument was a different drive then the boot
         drive, COMMAND.COM was looking for the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the drive
         of the argument instead of the boot drive.  Fixed so COMMAND.COM
         processes the AUTOEXEC.BAT from the boot drive.

    (4)  Version bumped to match DOSMAX

    (Version 1.8)::

    (1)  Added /S+ option to create a fake primary shell stub in low memory.
         This works around environment editor and network compatability
         problems.

    (2)  Improved error recovery with the goal of trying every way of at
         least loading some shell in the event the algorithum of SHELLMAX
         encounters multiple errors.

    (Version 1.9)::

    (1)  Reorganized code to enable an overlay method of module selection
         to automate processor selection and split up .SYS and .EXE modules
         to reduce the initialization memory to minimum.

    (2)  SHELLMAX now automatically detects the processor type and chooses
         separate code modules if appropriate.  The 186 processor require-
         ment of previous versions is no longer applicable.

    (3)  Added optional full word syntax to argument parser.  The old style
         single letter switch interface is still intact.  The switch lists
         now show the optional word with the switch.

    (Version 2.0)::

    (1)  Completely rewritten.  Added feature to edit command line if
         the SHELL is bad or missing.

    (2)  Added option response file input with @filename.opt syntax

    (Version 2.1)::

    (1)  Fixed problem with finding DOS 6.0 CONFIG variable for machines
         whose bios'es don't intialize memory properly.
