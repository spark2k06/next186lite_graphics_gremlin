       STOPMAX.SYS :  Ver. 2.1, Copyright (1992,93) by Philip B. Gardner
================================================================================

  STOPMAX.SYS is a derivative of DOSMAX.EXE.  The algorithums of DOSMAX which
  "stop" the DOS 5.0 and above kernel from loading into the HMA have been
  assembled separately into STOPMAX.SYS.  This allows DOSMAX.EXE to load high
  after the memory manager has installed and still put the DOS kernel into a
  UMB.  STOPMAX is specifically for DOS 5.0 and above users and will not work
  with DOS versions prior to DOS 5.0 and above.

  STOPMAX prevents DOS from loading into the HMA using one of the for methods
  which are also part of DOSMAX.  The default method "/B," patches the DOS
  5.0 and above initialization code.  This method and the "/V" (VDISK header
  method), do not require any resident memory, so STOPMAX simply executes and
  returns all memory to DOS.  DOSMAX should then be loaded as a DEVICE, after
  the memory manager and there is no restriction as to when DOSMAX should be
  installed.

  Support is provided for:

        * Stopping DOS from loading into the HMA

================================================================================

(Requirements)::

        * Requires MS-DOS Version 5.00 or above

================================================================================

(Installation)::

        (CONFIG.SYS)::

        Installation of STOPMAX.SYS requires modifying the contents of
        your CONFIG.SYS file.

(Generic Configuration)::

        This configuration should work and be the most efficient in 95%
        of all configurations.  For a few real world examples see
        EXAMPLES.DOC

        DOS=HIGH[,UMB]                    (DOS 5.0 and above only)
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS [options]      (Stops kernel from loading in HMA)
        DEVICE=(xms/umb memory manager)
        DEVICE=DOSMAX.EXE [options]       (DOSMAX loads high automatically)
        SHELL=SHELLMAX.COM COMMAND.COM /P
        BUFFERS=20
        FILES=40
        LASTDRIVE=Z

        DOS 5.0 and above users should configure DOS to load high into
        the HMA.  The UMB parameter is optional, since both DOS 5.0 and
        above upper memory management and XMS upper memory blocks are
        supported by DOSMAX.

        DOS=HIGH[,[UMB][NOUMB]] (Both DOS UMB's and XMS UMB's supported)

        Add a DEVICE= line for STOPMAX.SYS in your config.sys.  STOPMAX
        must be loaded before the XMS and UMB memory manager, but some
        memory managers provide high memory but not an HMA.  If your
        memory manager does not support an HMA, then STOPMAX is not
        necessary.  DOSMAX is then loaded "after" the memory manager

        HIMEM.SYS from Microsoft always puts the DOS 5.0 and above kernel
        into the HMA before it is through initializing and then puts its
        own code into the HMA.  If you are able to load HIMEM.SYS high
        (using some upper memory providers, not EMM386.SYS), you can now
        use the /I+ switch to stop HIMEM from loading DOS into the HMA,
        and STOPMAX will put it into a UMB instead.  The /B+ option (default)
        also stops HIMEM.SYS from putting the DOS kernel into the HMA.  If
        you use only DOS 5.0 and above files, meaning HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.SYS
        you should not use STOPMAX.

        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS [options]
        DEVICE=(Memory Manager)
        ......
        DEVICE=DOSMAX.EXE [options]

        By default, STOPMAX.SYS will generate a message for each successful
        operation or event.  The display then pauses to allow you to
        read the report.  After you are satisfied with the configuration
        and you want to disable the REPORT and PAUSE feature, use:

        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS /R- /P- 

        All switch options and possible messages for STOPMAX are detailed
        below:

================================================================================

(Syntax)::

        The only thing to remember about syntax for the command line is
        that just about anything works.  What this means is that you
        should be able to type in the options on the command line the
        way they make sense to you.

        To illustrate this point, the following command line example
        is mutated several different ways.

        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS /R- /P- /B+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS -R- -P- -B+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS R- P- B+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS R-P-B
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS -R-P-B

        ... and so on.

        STOPMAX 1.9 and above adds optional full word syntax.  The new
        syntax looks like this:

        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS /REPORT:- /PAUSE:- /IOPATCH:+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS -REPORT:- -PAUSE:- -IOPATCH:+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS REPORT:- PAUSE:- IOPATCH:+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS REPORT-PAUSE-IOPATCH:+
        DEVICE=STOPMAX.SYS -REPORT-PAUSE-IOPATCH:+

        Obviously when using full words, it is easier to keep the words
        separated so that is clear to read.  The optional [:] is used
        for toggle switches (i.e. REPORT:+).  These optional delimiters
        can also be used with the single letter switches.  Exact spelling
        is required because the single letter interface is still intact.

(Switch Options)::

        The following list of switch options is organized by:

          - Control of STOPMAX Reports (/R:/P:/N:)
          - Control the Location of the DOS Kernel (/B:/V:/I:)

    (Control of STOPMAX Reports)::

        (REPORT)::      R[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /R- or /REPORT:- to disable the report after you are
        satisfied with the configuration of STOPMAX.SYS

        (PAUSE)::       P[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /P- or /PAUSE:- to disable the pause after the report as
        long as there are no errors or warnings.

        (NOPAUSE)::     N[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /N+ or /NOPAUSE:+ to never pause after the report, even if
        there are errors.  This switch can be used if your configuration
        generates a warning or error message which you choose to ignore.

    (Control the Location of the DOS Kernel)::

        (IOPATCH)::     B[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /B+ or /IOPATCH:+ to stop DOS from loading in the HMA using
        a method which patches the copy of DOS 5.0 initialization code in
        memory when STOPMAX initializes.  This method will search and
        "patch out" the DOS to HMA code.  This option was developed and
        tested under MSDOS 5.0 and 6.0 and is not guaranteed to work with
        DOS versions later than 6.0, but then many of the algorithums in
        STOPMAX depend upon "undocumented" features of DOS which are always
        subject to change anyway.  The advantage of this method is that it
        works no matter which memory manager is used or how it is configured.

        (VDISK)::       V[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /V+ or /VDISK:+ to enable an alternate method of stopping
        DOS from allocating the HMA.  This switch is only necessary
        if STOPMAX reports that the DOS version is incompatible, and
        it will only work with memory managers which can detect a
        VDISK Header in the HMA when the memory manager initializes
        and mark's it as allocated.

        (STOPHIMEM)::   I[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /I+ or /STOPHIMEM:+ to stop HIMEM.SYS from loading DOS HIGH.
        This switch is intended for users who load HIMEM.SYS from
        Microsoft high after their UMB provider.  This option is not
        very useful if HIMEM.SYS is not loaded high because HIMEM will
        grow to about 30k in size.  If you still want to inhibit HIMEM,
        then load it last, to minimize the "growth."  The reason HIMEM
        "grows" is because the code which normally goes to the HMA is
        fixed at offset 0A000, so if HIMEM is loaded below 0A00h, the
        size of HIMEM grows to 0A00h + the size of the HMA code + the
        size of the XMS handle table.  This option affects the size of
        STOPMAX and adds 32 bytes.

(Changes)::

    (Version 1.6)::

    (1) Added check for a 186 processor or better (allows V20/V30).

    (2) Removed the check for an XMS manager and a check for extended
        memory.  This allows machines without extended memory to use
        UMB providers, which do not require extended memory, with STOPMAX.
        These checks were redundant since if DOS is in the HMA when
        STOPMAX loads, the message "DOS is HIGH already" is reported.

    (3) Added /I option which inhibits HIMEM.SYS from loading DOS HIGH.
        This switch is not very useful if HIMEM.SYS is not loaded high,
        since HIMEM will be about 30k in size.  This switch is intended
        for users who load HIMEM high after their UMB provider is installed.

    (4) Now supporting separate program STOPM86.SYS.  This program is 
        functionally identical to STOPMAX.SYS, but is compiled to work
        on 8086/8088 processors also.  I have learned that there are
        8086/8088 machines which can be configured with High Memory
        using some High Memory Managers, and this variation will make
        it possible for those users to put DOS in a UMB even though
        there is no HMA.  STOPM86.SYS requires 32 more bytes of memory.

   (5)  Added /B+ option which will stop DOS from going to the HMA by
        patching the DOS initilization code in memory.  This method
        works no matter which memory manager is in use or how it is
        configured.  It also requires no resident memory.  I made this
        the default method for STOPMAX.

   (Version 1.7)::

   (1)  Changed common parsing algorithum to support Hex-Notation input.
        This input method is not used in STOPMAX at this time.

   (Version 1.8)::

   (1)  Changes in STOPMAX common code for specific 386MAX support.

    (Version 1.9)::

    (1)  Reorganized code to enable an overlay method of module selection
         to automate processor selection and split up .SYS and .EXE modules
         to reduce the initialization memory to minimum.

    (2)  STOPMAX now automatically detects the processor type and chooses
         separate code modules if appropriate.  The 186 processor require-
         ment of previous versions is no longer applicable.

    (3)  Added optional full word syntax to argument parser.  The old style
         single letter switch interface is still intact.  The switch lists
         now show the optional word with the switch.

    (4)  STOPMAX updated for DOS 6.0.  Corrected a coding error while moving
         buffers.

    (Version 2.0)::

    (1)  Added response file input with @filename.opt syntax

    (Version 2.1)::

    (1)  Fixed problem with finding DOS 6.0 CONFIG variable for machines
         whose bios'es don't intialize memory properly.
