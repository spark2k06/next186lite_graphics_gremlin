  ENVIMAX.COM is the "move master environment" function split from earlier
  versions of DOSMAX.  Its function is to move the Master Environment of
  COMMAND.COM into upper memory.

  ENVIMAX does not support other shells like 4DOS/NDOS which move their own
  environments to upper memory.

  Support is provided for:

    * moving COMMAND.COM's master environment into upper memory
    * DOS Versions 3.1 - 3.31, DOS 4.x, DOS 5.x, and DOS 6.x

================================================================================

(Requirements)::

        * Requires MS-DOS Version 3.10 or better

================================================================================

(Installation)::

        Install ENVIMAX.COM in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  I recommend that ENVIMAX
        is the first program run in the AUTOEXEC.BAT

================================================================================

(Syntax)::

        The only thing to remember about syntax for the command line is
        that just about anything works.  What this means is that you
        should be able to type in the options on the command line the
        way they make sense to you.

        To illustrate this point, the following command line example
        is mutated several different ways.

        ENVIMAX.COM /E+
        ENVIMAX.COM E+
        ENVIMAX.COM E
        ENVIMAX.COM -E

        ENVIMAX 2.0 and above adds optional full word syntax.  The new
        syntax looks like this:

        ENVIMAX.COM /MASTERENV:+
        ENVIMAX.COM MASTERENV:+
        ENVIMAX.COM MASTERENV
        ENVIMAX.COM -MASTERENV:+

        Obviously when using full words, it is easier to keep the words
        separated so that is clear to read.  An optional [:] or [=] may be
        used for switches (i.e. REPORT:+ or REPORT=+).  These optional
        delimiters are used interchangeably and can also be used with the
        single letter switches.  Remember to check your spelling because
        the single letter interface is still intact.

(Switch Options)::

        The following list of switch options is organized by:

        - Control of ENVIMAX Reports (/R:/P:/N:)
        - Control of ENVIMAX Operation (/E:)
        - Response file for ENVIMAX (@)

  (Control of ENVIMAX Reports)::

        (REPORT)::      R[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /R- or /REPORT:- to disable the report after you are
        satisfied with the configuration of DOSMAX.EXE

        (PAUSE)::       P[+ or -]        (toggle:  default +)

        Use /P- or /PAUSE:- to disable the pause after the report as
        long as there are no errors or warnings.

        (NOPAUSE)::     N[+ or -]        (toggle:  default -)

        Use /N+ or /NOPAUSE:+ to never pause after the report, even if
        there are errors.  This switch can be used if your configuration
        generates a warning or error message which you choose to ignore.

  (Control of ENVIMAX Operation)::

        (MASTERENV)::    E[+ or -]       (toggle:  default +)     

        Use /E- or /MASTERENV:- to disable locating and moving the master
        environment to upper memory.  This switch is for diagnostic purposes
        only.

  (Response file for ENVIMAX)::

        Parameters for ENVIMAX may be read from a response file by using the
        @pathname syntax:
        
        ENVIMAX.COM @RESPONSE.FIL
 
        Response files may be commented by using a ";","#",or "*" character
        before the comment.

        There is also a feature implemented for DOS 6.0 config menus.  If a
        menu is configured for DOS 6.0, DOS puts the name of the effective
        section in an environment variable.  This environment variable is
        "CONFIG=."  You may optionally divide the response files into
        sections, identified with the familiar [SECTION] syntax, where
        "SECTION" is the name of the DOS 6.0 menu item selected.

        *  everything in square brackets "[]" is optional
